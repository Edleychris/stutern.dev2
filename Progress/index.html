        <h3>Name: Onwugbufor Nkiruka Edith</h3>
        <h4><i>MY LOVE FOR TECHNOLOGY</i></h4>
      <p>
        One of my professors in college <b>(Prof. Couch at Tufts University)</b> opened
        a class in Internet Architecture with an excellent speech that has
        shaped my whole professional career in technology. He said that people
        often think that networking is about connecting computers. It's not.
        It's about <b>connecting people.</b> I'm passionate about technology because
        its about building better tools. Tools by definition help you do work.
        And the work that we're doing is ultimately about people. I make web
        sites that help small businesses connect to their customers and
        non-profits connect to their members. I obsess over the newest gadgets
        for my smart home, but it's not about the gadgets, it's about enhancing
        and enriching my family's home life. Scratch the surface of any
        technology project, and you'll find some very human problem being solved
        in hopefully <i>clever ways.</i>
